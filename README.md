# A2-coursework

A2 Computing final project; 2002; VisualBasic

I'm not entirly sure if I should be uploading a project this old. Shows what happens if someone writes in Xojo (then REALBasic), then ports it to VisualBasic because that's the only language their teacher knows, and doesn't use proper version control at any point because nobody had yet told them it existed or why it was useful.

This project won me a £50 prize which I had no idea was on offer when I did the work.

The "expected" size of this project was about 20-30 pages — it's 261 pages because I felt like pushing myself. I had planned to turn this into shareware while at university, and got it into a much better state, but let it drop when I got a job after university, because, honestly, people who can't affort Photoshop are probably going to either get GIMP or something from a magazine cover disk. Well, that argument was relevant at the time I stopped, perhaps it's a good idea to revisit in the age of App Stores… but if I do, I'd probably re-write rather than try to convert given both how much I've learned and how many better ways of doing things have been created since then. I don't even know if I have the Xojo code anywhere any more, even if my licence hadn't long expired.

I assume this *isn't* the final version that I submitted because the "Appraisal" section is empty.

There was never version control on the source code, even if I can find the original code and not the stuff copy-pasted into a Word document. `git` had not yet been invented, REALbasic didn't work well with such things at the time, MacOS System 7 didn't have a command line, and neither my teacher nor any of my self-teaching books of the era knew anything about the few version control systems that did exist back then.
